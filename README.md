# Pawnder
Pawnder is a Tinder-like social network for dogs. The idea is to create a platform where dog owners can create profiles for their pets and find matches based on breed, age, and location.

For now, the project has been developed using basic HTML and CSS, but we plan to add JavaScript, React, and backend technologies in the near future to improve its functionality and performance.

## Current Features
Create profiles for dogs
Search for other dog profiles based on breed, age, and location
Display other dog profiles in card format
Give "like" or "dislike" to other dog profiles
## Future Plans
Implement chat functionality between dog owners who have matched
Add more advanced filtering options for dog profile search
Allow users to upload multiple photos of their dogs
Integrate payments to offer premium features
